# ISAAC *(Interactive System Advanced for Assistive Computer)* #
üçè *I am not set on this name and welcome input*

üçé *Named after Newton*

## How to use
* Download the repository and install the python packages in requirements.txt
* The program mainly uses the WolframAlpha API to respond, so you must obtain an API id from there website and paste only that into a file called waid.txt.

    waid.txt :
    ```
    ID_CODE
    ```
* For the weather, make an account for openweathermap and get an API key. paste this key into a file called weatherapi.txt. On a new line in this file, place your location. Not all locations are covered, so you may have to do the nearest large town/city.

    weatherapi.txt :
    ```
    API_KEY
    TOWN/CITY
    ```
* Finally, just run main.py. This will launch the GUI correctly and when the GUI is closed, the program will end.

## Next Features
I am working on adding a voice so that it can speak and eventually take voice input.
